- Practice and reinforce Unity and C# concepts  
- Test different gameplay ideas and mechanics  
- Build a foundation for future game projects

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Unity (latest stable version)
- C#
- Visual Studio / Rider
- Various Unity packages and assets

## 🚀 Notes
This project is primarily for learning and experimentation — expect lots of tests, prototypes, and code snippets from different lessons and tutorials.
